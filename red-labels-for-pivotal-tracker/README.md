# Red Labels for Pivotal Tracker

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker makes it very easy to see which of
your stories are blocked for development.

## Install the extension

Red Labels is available on [Chrome][] and on [Firefox][].

## Taxonomy

Any of these labels on stories will turn red:

- blocked
- needs <x>

My teams often use `needs assets` or `needs design` to signal our product
designer or `needs detail` to alert our product manager that their attention is
required.

## Future Work

I know that everyone has their own preferred taxonomy. I don't have any plans to add an ugly Chrome extension customization form.

## License

ISC License (included in the `LICENSE` file).
